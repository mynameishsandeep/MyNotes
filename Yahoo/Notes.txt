More than 75% of cart is abandoned without checkout because of distraction.
To simplify cart abandonment implementation, we're going to give merchants the option to move the 
email field first on Ship/Bill page. So that Email Marketing team can send mail to users to remind,
there are products in cart which needs to be purchased and they can provide discount on that sometimes.

ReCaptcha v3... decision based on points(0.0 to 1.0) of user browser fingerprint. Merchant can 
configure.
