Propagation: Typically, all code executed within a transaction scope will run in that transaction. However, you have the option of specifying the behavior in the event that a transactional method is executed when a transaction context already exists. For example, code can continue running in the existing transaction (the common case); or the existing transaction can be suspended and a new transaction created.

example scenario: In below txMethod2 already defined transactional behaviours. txMethod1 starts transaction. So txMethod1 can define when transaction exists on a callable method.
txMethod1() {
	fun()
	txMethod2();
	fun2();
}

txMethod2() {
	
}
