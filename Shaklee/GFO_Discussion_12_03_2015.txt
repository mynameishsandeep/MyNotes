ZooKeeper----> Registers and Discovers Micro Service.  

Feature Flag...>Publish the application 10%. If goes well 20%. If not going well turn off. Ex: Amazon sells phone every thursday at 1PM to 1.10PM. But if product sold at 1.10. Turn off the feature.

why zookeeper instead of eureka.

AWS can go offline anytime. But we are in clustered AWS.

graphDB...neo4j


database performance..


Ex: Single service... but how it will support for US, China, Taiwan... HOw the code will be organized.?
How service orchestrator and microservice handles logic...
Global perspective, what to keep commmon and what to make as service.
