 Running Functional Test in Local Environment

1) Start the Server with jacoco agent...
-javaagent:C:\dev\servers\jacoco-agent.jar=destfile=C:\dev\servers\jacoco.exec,jmx=true

2) Run the Individual User Test Case.

3) Open JConsole. Select the local process with catalina(for pivotal tc server)

4) Go to org.jacoco:type=Runtime... Click on Dump. 

5) Now you can see jacoco.exec is filled with data.

6) Import the jacoco.exec in Eclipse ECLEmma Coverage tool.

7) Main advantage of this approach. User can test the individual functional test cases.

How Testing team were doing functional testing:
1) They were using Jenkins to start the server, run jacoco agent on background, start testcase suite. 
2) This is a tedious process. All changes needs to be deployed on server. update suite. verify in sonarqube.
