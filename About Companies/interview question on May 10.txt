============
1) Generics is applied to which part of class? class, instance variable and method

2) which collection is best for searching ? if we use list... it is a linear search only... Utility like Collections.search() not efficient
	option 1) If you want dont want duplicates go for hashSet.It gives O(1)
	option 2) Use arrayList to store. During search. Put in to Set and get it.
	option 3) If you want duplicates to be maintained. Create hashMap like 
	
	Map<String, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<String, Integer>();

add custom logic to insert (i.e) if hashMap contains key increase the integer count by 1. 
So searching will result in O(1)+ O(1 or 2) based on logic..
