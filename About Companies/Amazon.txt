1) Given an single linked list find if the data is palindrome. No matter on space complexity. time complexity should be a max of O(n)
	a) assign 2 pointers. 1 move by 1 char, 2nd move by 2 char.
	b) put the data in stack for each char in 1pointer move.
	c) when 2nd pointer reaches end. take char from stack and compare it with each of 	next data. 
	d) if comparison success all the way end. it is palindrome, otherwise break the loop and return saying not palindrome.
2) Find the first occurance of non-repetetive character in a string. 
3)
